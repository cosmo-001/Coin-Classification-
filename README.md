# Coin-Classification-

In todayâ€™s modern society, coins continue to play a vital role in everyday transactions. However, annually identifying and sorting coins can be time-consuming and error prone. The solution lies in automated coin recognition systems.
The aim of this project was to use a computer vision approach for bank coin recognition to identify the properties of a particular bank coin in reference to a collection of coins. We look at several different techniques including Image processing and enhancement, Segmentation, Feature extraction and coin classification. The dataset used for this project is a collection of old and new coins which include, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, R1, R2 and R5 coins.
